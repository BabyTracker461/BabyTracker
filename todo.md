- [ ] fix font rendering (in header titles in iOS, and many places on Android)

    - shows a block of text summarizing anything notable
    - has bars of different tracking trends with a mini graph
    - click on any to expand into it's own page
- [ ] fix keyboard offset when typing in stuff
- [ ] remove animation / fade when timer is changing
- [ ] store timer state variables in local storage so they persist when navigated away
- [ ] store current time as object vs 1h or 1m string as we want it as numbers:

- [ ] design log page layout
